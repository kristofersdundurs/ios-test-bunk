Test

The task is to create a basic app with one UIViewController subclass, called TestVC.

TestVC should contain a single UICollectionView called containerCollection with
a vertical scroll direction, sized using your favourite autolayout constraints method.

The collection view should have a UICollectionReusableView as a header,
with height sized as Â¼ of the screen height as a default.

This header should also contain a UICollectionView called imageCollection,
this time, with a horizontal scroll direction and paging enabled.
Your imageCollection can have as many cells as you prefer, but no less than 2.
These cells have the same width and height as the imageCollection.

Each cell in the imageCollection should contain a UIImageView with
.scaleAspectFill ratio and should be populated with an image of your own preference.
You can use either local files or call images via URL.

When the containerCollection is pulled down, the header,
as well as its contents, should vertically stretch along with it.

There should should be 10 cells in your containerCollection.

Each cell should contain a UITextField.

These cells should always be full width, but should adapt
their height depending on the amount of text in their UITextField.

You should use https://swapi.co API to populate UITextField in each cell

Set UITextField.text for each cell equal to the value of "name" parameter of the API response, returned from any endpoint of your choice.

You should use a different endpoint for each cell.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feel free to adapt to your UICollectionViewDelegate and UICollectionViewDataSource protocols as you prefer.

You should use Swift 4.0 + for the task.
You should NOT use storyboards or xibs.
You CAN use internet, StackOverflow, etc., but you should NOT use
any dependencies, including cocoapods, etc.

Please get in touch with me via kris@gobunk.co.uk if you've got any questions.

Good luck!
